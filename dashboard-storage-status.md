# Dashboard Storage Status

## Dashboards without Persistent Storage

The following dashboards currently do not have persistent storage implemented:

1. thailand-malaysia-journey
   - Status: Storage files created but not yet imported
   - Required action: Add `<script src="index.js" type="module"></script>` to HTML file or import auto-storage in JS file

2. Any other existing dashboards
   - Status: No storage implementation
   - Required action: Add `<script src="index.js" type="module"></script>` to HTML file or import auto-storage in JS file

## Required Implementation Steps

To add persistent storage to all dashboards:

1. Ensure the following files exist in your DASHBOARDS directory:
   - `storage-manager.js` (core storage functionality)
   - `auto-storage.js` (automatic implementation)
   - `index.js` (easy inclusion for all dashboards)

2. For each dashboard HTML file, add:
   ```html
   <script src="index.js" type="module"></script>
   ```
   
   OR
   
   In each dashboard JS file, add:
   ```javascript
   import './auto-storage.js';
   ```

3. After implementation, test each dashboard by:
   - Making changes to form elements, checkboxes, etc.
   - Refreshing the page
   - Verifying that your changes were preserved

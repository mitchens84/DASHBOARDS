## Implementation Details

All dashboards now use the three-tier storage system:

1. **User-facing interaction**: Auto-detected form elements with event listeners
2. **Storage coordination**: `auto-storage.js` with mutation observer for dynamic elements
3. **Data persistence**: Unified `dashboardStorage` system with browser localStorage backend

## Adding Storage to New Dashboards

When creating new dashboards, run the setup script to automatically apply storage:

```bash
node setup-storage.js
```

This will find all HTML files in the content directory (including subdirectories) and add the necessary storage code.

## Testing

To test storage functionality, visit `/test.html` and use the built-in testing tools.

## Known Issues

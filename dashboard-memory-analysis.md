# Dashboard Memory Analysis

## Dashboards That Could Benefit From Memory

Based on analysis of the content folder, these dashboards would benefit from persistent storage:

1. **Thailand-Malaysia Journey**
   - Contains user progress tracking
   - Has interactive elements for travel planning
   - Would benefit from saving completed items and notes

2. **Sulphoraphane Information**
   - Contains dosage calculators
   - Has toggleable sections for detailed information
   - Would benefit from remembering user preferences and calculations

3. **Other Interactive Dashboards**
   - Any dashboard with form inputs
   - Dashboards with collapsible sections
   - Dashboards with checklists or progress tracking

## Implementation Plan

1. Create core storage system files
2. Add storage functionality to priority dashboards
3. Implement auto-storage system for easy addition to future dashboards
